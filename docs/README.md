Swanson OS Documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation for the Swanson OS project.

It's meant to serve as a reference page for developers of the project,
as well as place for newcomers to learn about how the system works.

You can find high-level explanations of the inner-workings of the project
in the 'Related Pages' tab. An explanation of the data structures used
in the project can be found in the 'Data Structures' tab. Headers and all
the definitions inside of them are also documented in the 'Files' tab.

This documentation was generated with the headers of the project and
several MarkDown files in the documentation directory, with a program
called Doxygen.
